			what is container Orchestration:container orchestration is a automatic way to manage the containers,which involves scaling,self-healing,networking,load balancing.
what is sidecar container: it's a container,which will run alongside of our main application container in the same pod.which is like helper container to send the app container logs to azure monitor or log analytics workspace.

Application deployed on k8s, experienceed incresed traffic,how would you scale the apps to handle the increased load: we can scale the apps either horizontally or vertically.
steps: first i will check resource utilization, such as CPU, memory.
1. if there spike in CPU/memory, i will increase the pods by using the Horizontal pod autoscaler.
2.if the issue is with the resource specific like it is running out of memory, then  will increase the CPU and memory limits by using the Vertical pod autoscaler.
what is the role of kube proxy in k8s: kube-proxy is a networking component that runs on every node in a Kubernetes cluster.Itâ€™s responsible for:
Routing network traffic to the correct pod based on Kubernetes Services.
what are the consideration to create high availabile k8s cluster: Creating a highly available (HA) Kubernetes cluster ensures that your applications remain resilient and accessible, even if components fail, we can create 
3 master nodes, and there is a load balancer in front of control plane, to distribute the traffic from external users.
we can deploy multiple worker nodes across availability zones.

what happens when a master node and worker node fails in k8s envi: when master node fails, cluster operates normally, pod management fails.
worker node component: load balancing will not work, new pods won't create.
