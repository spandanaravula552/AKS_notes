Taints and Tolerations are work together to ensure that pod should not place on inappropriate node.
Taint is applied to Node, Tolerations applied to pod.
to apply the taint to node: kubectl taint node <nodename> gpu=true:NoSchedule
these effects should apply to pod and node, the Effects are: NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule, NoExecute
NoSchedule
No new Pods will be scheduled on the tainted node unless they have a matching toleration.
To apply the tolerations to pod - we don't have option to apply using command, we can apply in pod yaml file.
ex: 
tolerations:
- key: "gpu"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
so then the pod is scheduled on to a node which have same taint that is gpu as key and true as value. 
To remove the taint from node: kubectl taint node <nodename> gpu=true:NoSchedule- (once u executed, you output as node untainted)
