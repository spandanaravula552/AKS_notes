Great effort! 🙌 You've captured the core of Kubernetes architecture really well. Here's your content with **grammar, vocabulary, and clarity improvements only**, while keeping your original structure and tone intact — ideal for LinkedIn or documentation.

🧠 **#Day02 of Kubernetes**
🎯 **Topic: Kubernetes Architecture**

Kubernetes is divided into two main parts:

1️⃣ **Control Plane (or Master Node)**
2️⃣ **Data Plane (or Worker Node)**

---

### 🔹 Control Plane Components:

The **Control Plane** manages the overall state of the Kubernetes cluster. It has the following components:

1. **API Server:**
   The **core and heart** of Kubernetes. It acts as the **frontend** of the control plane and exposes the Kubernetes cluster to external users.
   ➡️ All requests to the cluster (from users, kubectl, or controllers) first go through the API server.

2. **Scheduler:**
   Responsible for distributing containers (pods) across available nodes.
   ➡️ It watches for newly created pods that are **not yet assigned** to a node and chooses the best node to run them on.

3. **etcd:**
   A **key-value store** used to store **all configuration and state** data of the Kubernetes cluster.
   ➡️ Think of it as the **backup brain** of Kubernetes — storing everything from node status to secrets.

4. **Controller Manager:**
   Monitors and maintains the desired state of cluster resources.
   ➡️ It includes several controllers such as the **Node Controller** and **Replication Controller**, which handle node health and pod replication.

5. **Cloud Controller Manager:**
   Responsible for managing cloud-specific integrations (e.g., with AWS, Azure, GCP).
   ➡️ This component **only exists in cloud environments** and is not present in on-prem setups.

---

### 🔹 Data Plane Components:

The **Data Plane** (or Worker Nodes) is responsible for **actually running the applications**.

1. **Kubelet:**
   An agent that runs on **every node** in the cluster.
   ➡️ It ensures that containers are running inside pods as expected on each node.

2. **Kube-Proxy:**
   Handles **Kubernetes networking**.
   ➡️ It assigns IPs to new pods and manages **network traffic routing** within the cluster — especially as pods scale based on load.

---

### 🧠 Summary:

In simple terms:
🔸 **Control Plane** = Controls the cluster (decision-making)
🔸 **Data Plane** = Executes the instructions (runs your apps)
