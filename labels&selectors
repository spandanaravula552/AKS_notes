what is a label: Label in k8s is nothing but tag,  used to identify the pods, nodes, relica sets.
for ex: in kitchen, we attach stickey notes to the boxes, like this is salt, this is tea.
so here boxes is nothing but resources like pods, nodes, notes is nothing but label. labels are just little tags to help identify them.


What is Selector: selector is used in deployment, replica set, load balancer, ingress services.
this is used to find and connect to the right pods.
ex: give me the boxes which have the stickey notes of salt.
