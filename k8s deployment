k8s Deployment: The difference between container pod and deployment.
we create the container using the command mentionining it specifications like container name, img name, port, network details.
for creation of pod we use yaml manifest, by mentioning the container specifications, but pod can contain one or more containers.
The deployment resource which will track the k8s replica set controller behaviour/it's state , behind it will create replica set, at the end it will creates pods only.
replica set is a controller which will maintain the desired state of deployment yaml manifest .
while creating the deployment, we will mention how many replica set we need in yaml manifest.
for ex: in deployment yaml file, we mentioned two replica sets, then it creates 2 pods, if user automatically deletes one pod, replica set as controller creates one more pod, because in submitted yaml file , we mentioned
that we need 2 replica set, so it has the feature of auto-healing.
